# =============================================================================
# SLAM Toolbox Parameters — Real Hardware (LattePanda Alpha + RPLidar C1)
# =============================================================================
# Robot: Daniel's differential drive (130 RPM motors, 69mm wheels)
# Computer: LattePanda Alpha (Core i5, 7.6 GB RAM — memory constrained)
# LiDAR: RPLidar C1 (USB, ~10 Hz scan rate)
# =============================================================================
# TUNING NOTES:
#   - This system has only ~300 MB free RAM during full SLAM+RViz operation.
#   - Parameters are tuned to prevent slam_toolbox from crashing under load.
#   - If map quality is poor, try reducing throttle_scans or minimum_time_interval.
