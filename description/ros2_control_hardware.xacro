      ros2_control hardware interface for REAL robot.
      This is a placeholder — on real hardware, wheel commands and
      encoder feedback are handled by the Arduino serial node,
      NOT by ros2_control. The diff_drive_node.py node handles
      cmd_vel → motor commands and encoder → odom directly.

      We keep this xacro so the URDF remains valid and joint_state_publisher
      can still provide transforms for RViz visualization.

    <!-- No ros2_control hardware plugin needed for real hardware.
         The Arduino serial bridge node handles motor control and odometry. -->
